# Applied Software Design : ECE 3574
This is the repository for my class at Virginia Tech on Applied Software Design. It features code made for running on x86 computer running Ubuntu 14.04 with QT5.

In this class, we learned the following things:
* QT4 and QT5 with QTCreator using qmake on the command line to generate applications
* Multi Window QT GUI applications to support user functionality
* Classes with Friends and how to utilize Object Oriented Programming in code
* Polymorphism and Abstract Classes with Virtual
* Semaphores and Mutexs used with POSIX Message Queues in a multi threaded application
* Instantiation of multiple processes and how to safely utilize them altogether to access memory
